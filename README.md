# Taras' Numerical Modelling Course
Conversion of Taras Matlab models to Python 3

Here you'll find Python 3 versions of some of the models originally developed in Matlab as part of Taras Gerya's introduction to Numerical Modelling.

The aim is to offer an open source alternative to interested students, and compare computation times and code readability between Python and Matlab.

This repository is a work in progress.
